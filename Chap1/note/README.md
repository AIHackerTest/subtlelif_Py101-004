## Approach

* open and read files

~ print(f[num]):a good try to conform the reading

* set up the dict of weather_info

It took most of time to figure out the setup though understood the concept of key and value, with asigts of @guoyuming and @linfeng365, finally realized the differences betw list[], dict{} which made up by lists of strings. So how to get 2 lists of string formatted without quotes,slash? The given format that city paired up with weather by comma was really smoothen to the problem_solving. By using for_in_ to shape items of the list, the dict was with lists of city and weather, and variable of input(city):w_detail[r] = wea_detail.



* dict.key()???

* while_loop

while true: -- on and endless


* the functions to start and to respose to the unexpected input

if, elif, else: way to go.
